The compiled version of Source code was not able to detect Real Sense SDK on my computer.
Hope It works there.

Otherwise, It works without any error on unity.
I have attached the source code zip.
Steps for using the code.

1.Extract the Zip
2.Go To New Unity Project\Assets\
3.Open default.unity to open project and wait for unity to load
4.Use playbutton at middle on top or CTRL+P to start the game
5.Voila!!! Challenge and Beat your collegues at this supercool game.


***Full version would have emotions, Face and smoother tracking****

Thanks
